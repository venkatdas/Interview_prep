## Array.findIndex()


- The findIndex method is a built-in array method in JavaScript that **allows you to find the index of the first element in the array** that satisfies a provided testing function. If no elements in the array satisfy the testing function, it returns -1.
- This method is useful when you need to locate the position of an element in an array based on a condition

```js
//Syntax

const index = array.findIndex(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])
```
