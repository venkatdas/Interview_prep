## Call polyfill 

syntax

`function.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`



```js
let car1={

  color:"Red",
  company:"Ferrari"

}

function purchaseCar(currency,price){
  console.log(`I have purchased ${this.color} and ${this.company} car for ${currency} ${price}`);
}

purchaseCar.call(car1,"$",657365); //I have purchased a Red Ferrari car for $657365.


```

- Above one is the example one now we can make polyfill based on the above code

**Approach**

```js

Function.prototype.myCall =  function (context ={}, ...args) {
  //context is empty object
  // we don't know how many arguments are there so used ...args rest operatot

  if(typeof this !== 'function'){
    throw new Error (this +' it is not  callable')
  }
// context is object, we can add function into that
  context.fn = this;
  context.fn(...args)



  
}
```

`purchaseCar.myCall(car1,"$",657365);`  gives the same result as normal call
