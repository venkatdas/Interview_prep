- Redux is a popular library for managing state in JavaScript applications, particularly useful with React, though it can be used with other frameworks too.

**Core Concepts of Redux**

1) **Actions**

- Actions are JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application. They must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. They can also have additional data fields, called the payload.
- In other words action test the reducer, what to do and how to manipulate the state.

- **Example Action: { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Learn Redux' }**

2) **Reducers**
- Reducers are resposible for directly changing the state of aotr app, its basically a function that takes action and current state as arguments and returns new state reuslts.
- Reducers are pure functions that take the current state of the application and an action, and return a new state. They describe how the state changes in response to actions.
- Reducers must be pure functionsâ€”functions that return the exact same output for given inputs. They should not have side effects like API calls or routing transitions.
- Example Reducer: A reducer that handles the above action by adding a new todo to the state.


 3) **Store**

- The store is the object that brings actions and reducers together. The store holds the application state and provides a few helper methods to access the state, dispatch actions, and register listeners.
- The entire state of a Redux application is stored in a single store.


**How the flow works**

- Application(UI)->Actions->Reducers->Store-> Application(useSelector)
