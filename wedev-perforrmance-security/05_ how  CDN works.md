## CDN

- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers strategically located around the globe designed to deliver digital content (such as websites, images, videos, and applications) to users more quickly, securely, and reliably.
- It is a distributed network of servers located in various data centers around the world.

- CDN management software dynamically calculates which server is located nearest to the user, making the request and delivering content based on those calculations
- However, when a website uses a CDN, the content is distributed across multiple edge servers located closer to the end-users.
- These edge servers acts as caches for the website's content.
