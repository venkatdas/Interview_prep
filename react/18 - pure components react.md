- In React, a "pure component" is a specific type of component that optimizes performance by minimizing re-renders
- A React pure component only re-renders if the state or props have changed. This is determined by a shallow comparison of both props and state, making them more efficient in some scenarios.
- PureComponent is similar to Component but it skips re-renders for same props and state.
- Class components are still supported by React, but we donâ€™t recommend using them in new code.
