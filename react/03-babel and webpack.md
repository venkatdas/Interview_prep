## Babel:


- Babel is simply a translator, who translates your 'fancy' (ES6+) JS code into 'not-so-fancy' (ES5) ones that browser (front-end) or Node.js (back-end) understands.
- Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write code using the latest ECMAScript (ES) features, and then transpile it back into an older version of JavaScript that is widely supported across browsers.

**Key Functions of Babel:**

- Transpilation: Converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) into an older version (ES5) for compatibility.
- Polyfilling: Provides missing features in older environments, e.g., Promise, Array.includes, etc.
- JSX and TypeScript Support: Babel can transform JSX (used in React) and TypeScript into regular JavaScript.
- Plugins and Presets: Allows customization of the transpilation process using plugins and presets.


- Below is a fancy code that most developers write today. Despite of how fancy it is, our browser / Node.js has no idea what it's talking about. (Note: Some Node.js higher versions have ES6 support now.)

```js
// ES6 syntax
import moment from 'moment';

export default () => moment().format("YYYY Do MM");
```

- And this is why we need Babel to translate above into the equivalent not-so-fancy code below, that our browser / Node.js actually understands.


```js
// ES5 syntax
const moment = require('moment')

function getDateString() {
  const date = moment();
  return date.format("YYYY Do MM");
}

exports.default = getDateString;
```


- That's why Babel is sometimes called a transpiler.

- It's worth noting that Babel is commonly used for both front- and back-end. Why do I mention this? Because Webpack is front-end only (in most cases).


## Webpack




- If Babel is a translator for JS, you can think of Webpack as a mega-multi-translator that works with all kinds of languages (or assets). For example, Webpack often runs Babel as one of its jobs. Another example, Webpack can collect all your inline CSS styles in your Javascript files and bundle them into one.

-  Frontend: we use Webpack (which uses Babel and other things) to compile JS code and many other assets into a few small bundle files that our users can download when they first load our webpage. For example, create-react-app uses Webpack and Babel when creating your app.



**Key Functions of Webpack:**


- Bundling: Combines multiple JavaScript files (and other assets) into one or several bundles to reduce the number of HTTP requests.
- Loaders: Transforms and converts files (like SCSS to CSS, or TypeScript to JavaScript) before bundling.
- Plugins: Provides a wide range of functionalities, like minification, optimization, etc.
- Code Splitting: Splits the codebase into smaller chunks, which can be lazy-loaded to improve site performance.
- Dev Server: Provides a local development server with live reloading.
