## Ref

- "Refs" in React provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.
- They are used when you need direct access to a DOM element or a child component in order to manage focus, select text, or trigger animations. Refs can also be useful when integrating third-party DOM libraries.

**- When to use Refs**

- There are a few good use cases for refs:

- Managing state that should not trigger any re-render.

- Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.

- Triggering imperative animations.

- Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.
