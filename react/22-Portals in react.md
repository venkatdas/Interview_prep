## Portals in React

- Portal is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
- This is particularly useful for components like modals, tooltips, and dropdowns, which you might need to render in a different part of the DOM to prevent CSS overflow issues or to avoid unwanted parent styling.
