- Modularity: Breaking down the software into smaller, independent, and reusable components or modules. This makes the software easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details of a module or component and exposing only the necessary information. This makes the software more flexible and easier to change.
- Encapsulation: Wrapping the data and functions of a module or component into a single unit, and providing controlled access to that unit. This helps to protect the data and functions from unauthorized access and modification.
