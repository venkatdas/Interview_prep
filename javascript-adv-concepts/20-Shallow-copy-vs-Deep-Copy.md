### Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

- Before that
- Pure functions require you to aviod mutating the original data
- Impure function mutates the original data



**Shallow Copy**

- Definition: A shallow copy is a copy of the original object that only copies the references to the objects nested within, not the objects themselves. This means that changes to the nested objects in the copy will affect the original object.
- Use Cases: Useful when you only need to copy the immediate properties, but donâ€™t need to worry about changing nested objects.
**Examples:**
- Object.assign() can be used for shallow copying.
- Using the spread operator (...).

**Ex:**

```js
const scoreArray = (array, score) => {
  array.push(score);

  return array;
};

const resultArray =[34,45,23,24]

console.log(scoreArray(resultArray,28));
```
- It will mutate the original array
- Note: `const` does not make immutable


### Shallow Copy. Objects are reference typed

- Even if I change the second object still it got reflected to object1

- To avoid this we can use two methods
  1) Object.assign();

2) Spread Operator

### Deep Copy
- what if multiple nested objects are there the above two methods won't work


- Definition: A deep copy creates a completely independent clone of the original object, including its nested objects. This way, changes made to nested objects in the copy won't affect the original.
- Use Cases: Ideal when you need a complete, independent copy of the original object.
