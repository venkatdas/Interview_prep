### Currying


- Currying is a technique of translating a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into f(a)(b)(c).
- It involves breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.

- A function takes one argument at a time and return aneother function and expecting the aneother argument.

  This is normal function and will convert this to currying

**Why should currying be used?**

Following are the reasons why currying is good :

✅ It makes a function pure which makes it expose to less errors and side effects.

✅ It helps in avoiding the same variable again and again.

✅ It is a checking method that checks if you have all the things before you proceed.

✅ It divides one function into multiple functions so that one handles one set of responsibility.
