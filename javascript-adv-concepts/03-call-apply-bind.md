### Call and Apply



  - Both `.call` and `.apply are used to invoke functions and the first parameter will be used as the value of this within the function.
  However, `.call` takes in comma-separated arguments as the next arguments while `.apply` takes in an array of arguments as the next argument.
  An easy way to remember this is C for `call` and comma-separated and A for `apply` and an array of arguments.
