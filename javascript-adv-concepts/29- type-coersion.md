### Type Coersion

- Type coercion happens when we **have double equal to (==),** so this simply means compare two values if both are of different type,
- coerce one into the same type
- Two types of conversions are there
  **1) ImPlicit Conversion**


- Implicit coercion occurs when JavaScript automatically converts one data type into another.
- This conversion happens behind the scenes when you perform operations on values of different types.

**2) Explict coersion**

-Explicit coercion, on the other hand, is when you manually convert values from one type to another using JavaScript's built-in functions or constructs.
