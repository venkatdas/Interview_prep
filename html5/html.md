1 ) Html5 Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Website Title</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <section>

            <h2>Article Title</h2>
            <p>Article content goes here.</p>
        </article>
        <aside>
            <h2>Related Links</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Link 2</a></li>

2) Explain meta tag in html

The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.



**Character Encoding:** It specifies the character set used on the webpage, which is crucial for correctly displaying text, especially for languages with unique characters. A common practice is to set the character encoding to UTF-8, which supports most characters and symbols from all writing systems.


`<meta charset="UTF-8">`

**Viewport Configuration for Mobile Devices:** It controls the viewport's size and scale, which is particularly important for creating responsive designs that work well on mobile devices. For example, setting the viewport width to device-width and the initial scale to 1 ensures that the page uses the device's width and scales properly.


`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

**Page Description:** It provides a brief description of the page's content, which search engines often display in search results. A well-crafted description can improve the chances of someone clicking on a link.


`<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the page">`

**Keywords:** Although less significant for SEO now due to past abuse, it was traditionally used to specify keywords relevant to the page's content to improve search engine rankings.


`<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">`

**Author:** It can specify the name of the author of the webpage.


`<meta name="author" content="John Doe">`

**Refresh and Redirection:** It can be used to refresh the page or redirect to another page after a specified number of seconds.


`<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30; url=http://example.com/">`

**Controlling Browser Caching:** It can instruct the browser how to cache the page, although HTTP headers often handle this more effectively.

**Social Media Integration and SEO:** Meta tags such as Open Graph (used by Facebook) and Twitter Cards tags are used to control how content appears when shared on social media platforms, including specifying images, descriptions, and other elements for rich previews.


**3)  What is the role of the 'alt' attribute in the 'img' tag?**

The `alt` attribute in the <img> tag specifies alternative text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed for any reason. This attribute plays several crucial roles in web development and accessibility:

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Search engines index the alt text, which helps them understand the content of the image and the context in which it's used on the webpage. Properly described alt text can improve the visibility of a website in search engine results, especially in image search results.

`<img src="example.jpg" alt="Description of the image">`


4) What is the significance of the 'form' element in HTML?

5) Explain the difference between 'GET' and 'POST' methods in form submissions.
**6) Discuss the importance of the 'semantic' elements in HTML5.**


Semantic elements in HTML5 provide clear information about their content to both the browser and the developer, improving accessibility, SEO, code readability, and maintainability. They make web pages more accessible to users with disabilities, enhance search engine optimization by helping search engines understand the page structure, and improve code clarity for developers. Examples include <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, <nav>, and <section>, each defining specific parts of a web page's content or structure.

**7) What is the purpose of the 'head' section in an HTML document?**

The <head> section in an HTML document is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> and <body> tags. It does not display content directly on the web page but serves several important purposes for the document:

The <head> section of an HTML document contains metadata and links to external resources like CSS and JavaScript. It sets the page title, character encoding, styles, scripts, and other information like meta descriptions and viewport settings that don't appear visually on the page but influence its presentation and behavior.

**8) Differentiate between 'id' and 'class' attributes in HTML.**


In HTML, both id and class attributes are used to identify and apply styles to elements, but they serve different purposes and follow different rules:

**id:** An id must be unique within an HTML document. It is used to identify a single, unique element. No two elements should have the same id value on a single page. In CSS, an id is referenced with a hash (#) prefix (e.g., #header). It's often used for styling elements that occur once on a page or for JavaScript operations that target a specific element.

**class**  A class can be used on multiple elements within the same document. It is used to group elements that share the same styling or are meant to be targeted together with scripts or styles. In CSS, a class is referenced with a dot (.) prefix (e.g., .button). Classes are useful for applying the same style rules to multiple elements and for JavaScript operations that affect groups of elements.
